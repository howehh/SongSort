# SongSort
A tiny program for helping me sort the songs that AjocBot can queue up

1. Install JSON-Java
   https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java
   
2. Create a JAR from a project that includes the JSON-Java JAR, SongSorter.java and SongSortGUI.java (GUI as the main)
   > "Create JAR or Zip File for Project"
   > Include json jar in additional non-project files 

3. EZ clapper, execute the JAR file
